# RGB Matrix Project
This repository contains all the relevant files for making and driving a matrix of RGB LEDs. The `hardware` folder contains the designs for the matrices. The general approach is to use 74HC595 shift registers to drive the matrix of LEDs through multiplexing. 

More information on this project and links to purchase parts kits can be found at my [LED Matrix website](http://kamprath.net/led-matrix/).
